        lyrics: `[Verse 1]<br>
        I went away to see an old friend of mine<br>
        His sister came over, she was out of her mind<br>
        She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin<br>
        She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in<br>
        Her light eyes were dancing, she is insane<br>
        Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain<br>
        She keeps coming closer saying, "I can feel it in my bones<br>
        Schizophrenia is taking me home"<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        My future is static<br>
        It's already had it<br>
        I could tuck you in<br>
        And we can talk about it<br>
        I had a dream<br>
        And it split the scene<br>
        But I got a hunch<br>
        It's coming back to me<br>`

        Kiss<br>
        Your fear<br>

        Move<br>
        On top<br>
        Because that way<br>
        You touch her, too<br>
        Turn<br>
        Your head<br>
        Come back again<br>

        lyrics: `[Verse 1]<br>
        And if the snow buries my<br>
        My neighborhood<br>
        And if my parents are crying<br>
        Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours<br>
        Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        You climb out the chimney and meet me in the middle<br>
        The middle of the town<br>
        And since there's no one else around, we let our hair grow long<br>
        And forget all we used to know<br>
        Then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow<br>
        <br>        
        [Chorus]<br>
        You change all the lead, sleeping in my head<br>
        As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 3]<br>
        Then we tried to name our babies but we forgot all the names that...<br>
        The names we used to know<br>
        But sometimes we remember our bedrooms and our parent's bedrooms<br>
        And the bedrooms of our friends<br>
        Then we think of our parents, well, what ever happened to them?<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        You change all the lead, sleeping in my head to gold<br>
        As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn<br>
        It's the song I've been trying to sing<br>
        <br>
        [Outro]<br>
        Purify the colors, purify my mind<br>
        Purify the colors, purify my mind<br>
        And spread the ashes of the colors over this heart of mine!`
